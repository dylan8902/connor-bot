## What can it do?
It can ask you for your name and repeat back what you say

## Integrations
I have tested the following integrations with the bot framework

### Skype
I have enabled Skype integration:  
https://join.skype.com/bot/e44e2e7a-021b-4d61-9d87-f678a97cfc14

### Facebook
I have created a Facebook application and associated page:  
https://developers.facebook.com/apps/688876841301576  
https://www.facebook.com/theconnorbot

The messaging permissions have been added, however the integration does not appear to be working

### Slack
I have created a slack application and linked the bot to it:

It is a member of the dylanjones team, in the bots channel:
